# Sysinfo

OpenBSD specific lightweight screenfetch script

This is script is based on a script by Linux Dabbler: https://github.com/linuxdabbler?tab=repositories
and ufetch: https://gitlab.com/jschx/ufetch.

The script has been modfied and set up so that with a couple of changes to the *Info* section
it will display the right system infomation on the script.

The distro ascii art also has to be changed, and the colors moddifed to by changing the names
to fit the *nix distro.

The DE (Desktop Environment) indentier is not yet in a working state on OpenBSD. Howver I figured that most OpenBSD of us use WM 
on it, so I didn't think to spend much time on it. 

If I should look into adding something or something is missing please let me know.
