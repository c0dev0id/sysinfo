# sysinfo

OpenBSD specific lightweight screenfetch script

This is script is based on a script by Linux Dabbler: https://github.com/linuxdabbler?tab=repositories
and ufetch: https://gitlab.com/jschx/ufetch.

The script has been modfied and set up so that with a couple of changes to the *Info* section
it will display the right system infomation on the script.

The distro ascii art also has to be changed, and the colors moddifed to by changing the names
to fit the *nix distro.
