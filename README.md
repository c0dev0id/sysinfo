OpenBSD specific lightweight screenfetch script

This is script is based on a script by Linux Dabbler: https://github.com/linuxdabbler?tab=repositories
and ufetch: https://gitlab.com/jschx/ufetch.

The DE (Desktop Environment) indentier is not yet in a working state on OpenBSD. Howver I figured that most OpenBSD of us use WMs on it, so I didn't think to spend much time on it. 

If I should look into adding something or something is missing please let me know.
